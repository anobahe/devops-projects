# Containerizing Java Project Using Docker

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to containerize a Java web application using Docker. The project showcases the scalability, portability, and cost-efficiency of Docker containers while leveraging multiple services such as NGINX, Memcached, RabbitMQ, MySQL, and Tomcat. By using Docker, the deployment process becomes faster, more efficient, and adaptable to varying resource demands.

## Features
- **Scalability**: Docker containers are highly scalable to meet application demands.
- **Portability**: Docker images are built once and can run anywhere, ensuring consistent environments.
- **Cost-efficiency**: Reduced infrastructure costs by running multiple containers on a single machine.
- **Faster Deployment**: Containers are easier and faster to manage compared to traditional virtual machines.
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Scale resources up or down dynamically based on demand.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Efficient utilization of system resources by running containers on a single host.

## Services Used
The following services were integrated into the Dockerized setup:
- **NGINX**: Acts as a web server and reverse proxy.
- **Memcached**: Provides in-memory caching to optimize application performance.
- **RabbitMQ**: Implements messaging queues for asynchronous communication.
- **MySQL**: Serves as the relational database.
- **Tomcat**: Hosts the Java web application.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Find the Right Base Image**: Searched for appropriate base images for each service on Docker Hub.
2. **Write Dockerfiles**: Customized Dockerfiles for services that required specific configurations.
3. **Write Docker Compose File**: Created a `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate and manage multiple containers.
4. **Testing**: Verified the functionality of the setup in a local environment.
5. **Host Images**: Uploaded Docker images to Docker Hub for reuse and sharing.

## Repository Contents
The project repository includes:
1. **Reference Diagram**: Visual representation of the containerized architecture.
2. **Screenshots**: Deployment process and final setup screenshots.
3. **Docker Files**:
   - Customized Dockerfiles for each service.
   - `docker-compose.yml` for multi-container orchestration.

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Build the Docker images:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```
4. Start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
5. Access the application:
   - NGINX and Tomcat services will expose endpoints on the configured ports.

## Benefits of This Project
- Demonstrates a comprehensive approach to containerizing a web application.
- Illustrates the advantages of using Docker for microservices architecture.
- Provides a reusable template for similar projects.
